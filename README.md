# README

This repository contains the official data and source code for
"[On the Sustainability of Large-Scale Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare"](https://arxiv.org/)", Raghavendra Selvan. 2025



### Method

* Official websites or publications for each of the datasets were checked to see if details like _number of samples, image resolution_ were provided. If yes, these were used. 

* For datasets where there were no official websites or publications, sample data was downloaded and checked manually. 

* When a dataset contained images of varying resolutions, then the average resolution per axis was used.

* For data with multiple channels or sequences, they were populated along the z-axis for ease.
